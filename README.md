# InventoryManagementSystem
Developed a comprehensive inventory management system utilizing Python and SQLite, showcasing proficiency in database management and programming. Designed an intuitive command-line interface that allowed users to interact with the system efficiently. 
basic inventory management system using Python and SQLite involves designing a simple database to store item information and building a command-line interface for users to interact with the system. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Step 1: Set Up SQLite Database

Install the SQLite library for Python if you haven't already: pip install sqlite3.
Create a new SQLite database file, e.g., "inventory.db".
Define a table named "items" with columns like "id" (integer), "name" (text), "quantity" (integer), and "price" (real).

Step 2: Create Python Script
Create a Python script, e.g., "inventory_system.py", to interact with the database and handle user input.

Step 3: Run the System
Run the "inventory_system.py" script using your preferred Python interpreter. The system will present a menu where users can choose to add items to the inventory or display existing items. The data will be stored in the SQLite database
